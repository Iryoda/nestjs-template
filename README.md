## ðŸ§¿ How to use
First you will need a docker postgresql database, for make it easer use `docker-compose` to run the `docker-compose.yml` file that will up a docker container with the already configured db

The default configurations is:
```yml
  database:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'docker'
      POSTGRES_USERNAME: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'nest-template'
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
```
On the project root you can run:

```shell

docker-compose up -d

``` 

With the container up you can run the prisma command to migrate your database:

```shell
yarn prisma migrate dev
```

If everything is right you should have your project ready and to run  it on development enviroment use:

```shell

yarn dev

```
For production first you should compile it with:
```shell

yarn build

```


Then to run the production enviroment use:

```shell

yarn start

```

### ðŸ“• Customizing

If you whant to change the db name you should alter the postgresql url on `.env` and apply the same changes to the `docker-compose.yml`

```env
# .env file
# Change the database name to dogDB

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:docker@localhost:5432/dogDB?schema=public"
```

```yml
# docker-compose.yml file
 environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'docker'
      POSTGRES_USERNAME: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'dogDB'
    ports:
...
```
